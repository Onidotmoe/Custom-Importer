# Custom Importer
Custom Importers for Monogame's Pipeline tool.

## Byte Importer
  Allows you to import any generic file into the pipeline tool and have it end up as a .xna file.

## String Importer
  Defaults to .txt files but can really take any generic text file.
  
## Note
  Both the importers have processors but they don't really do anything, i'll leave it like that incase you or i want to put something inbetween there.
